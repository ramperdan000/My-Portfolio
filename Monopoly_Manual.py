            This is a strategy guide to help you win Monopoly. For each property group on the board, I will explain strategies for them.
            General Strategy:
            You generally want to develop a Monopoly (there are some preferences) as quickly as possible. You will probably have to do this through trading. Don't make super-
            unreasonable deals, but be willing to spend more than you want to. Buy as many properties as you can, and participate in as many auctions as possible. You will want to stop
            bidding when the price becomes unreasonable, even if you need the property. Simply trade for it later. The most rolled number is seven, so you might always want to develop on a
            space your opponent is seven away from. Also, you should watch out for whatever is seven spaces from you, and be prepared for whatever comes next.
            Strategy for Go:
            You want to be landing on or going past Go as many times as you can. Every time you go to Go, you receive $200, which is always a good thing to have.
            Another reason for passing Go is that its side of the board doesn't really pose major threats (for the most part). There are also several cards that can send you to Go.
            There are few Chance and Community Chest cards that can enable you to pass Go or go directly to Go.
            Strategy for Chance and Community Chest:
            These cards can make you or break you. One good chance cards can give you a much needed few hundred dollars, or cost you hundreds you can't afford. This is 
            especially true of the property repairs cards that hit the hardest against those who have spent all their money on houses or hotels. It is always a good idea to keep a few
            hundred dollars handy to help counteract the negative affects of these cards.""")

            The brown properties are the worst property investment in the game until you build hotels on them. Mediterranean Avenue is the least landed on property in the entire
            game, and the rent for both properties is insanely low. In order to achieve their return value, they must be developed into hotels. However, it's never a bad idea to have
            one or both on hand, as they can be useful for trades and as a minor source of income.""")

            don't spend your money on anything until you pass the space. You won't end up losing anything.""")
